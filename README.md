## Game Mechanics

- Enemies spawn from the top and move downward
- Player must avoid enemy collisions (game over on contact)
- Shooting enemies awards points
- Collect power-ups for **permanent upgrades** that stack and level up
- Game difficulty increases with each level
- **Swarm Enemies**: Visual units decrease as you shoot them

## Architecture

The game is built with a modular, extensible architecture:

### Core Classes

- **Game**: Main game loop and state management
- **Player**: Player movement, shooting, and power-up handling
- **Enemy**: Base enemy class with multiple types
- **Bullet**: Projectile system
- **Powerup**: Base power-up class with multiple types
- **AudioManager**: Sound effect management

### Extensibility

#### Adding New Enemy Types

1. Create a new class extending `Enemy`:
```javascript
class NewEnemy extends Enemy {
    constructor(x, y, laneIndex) {
        super(x, y, laneIndex);
        this.type = 'newenemy';
        this.color = '#colorcode';
        // Customize properties
    }
}
```

2. Register in `EnemyFactory`:
```javascript
const enemyClasses = {
    'basic': BasicEnemy,
    'newenemy': NewEnemy  // Add here
};
```

#### Adding New Power-up Types

1. Create a new class extending `Powerup`:
```javascript
class NewPowerup extends Powerup {
    constructor(x, y) {
        super(x, y);
        this.type = 'newpowerup';
        this.color = '#colorcode';
        this.duration = 10000;
    }
    
    apply(player) {
        // Implement power-up effect
    }
}
```

2. Register in `PowerupFactory`:
```javascript
const powerupClasses = {
    'rapidfire': RapidFirePowerup,
    'newpowerup': NewPowerup  // Add here
};
```

#### Adding Sound Effects

Use the `AudioManager` to register and play sounds:

```javascript
// Register a sound
audioManager.registerSound('soundname', 'path/to/sound.mp3');

// Play a sound
audioManager.play('soundname');
```

## Configuration

Game parameters can be adjusted in `js/utils.js`:

- `CANVAS_WIDTH`, `CANVAS_HEIGHT`: Game canvas dimensions
- `LANE_COUNT`: Number of lanes
- `BULLET_SPEED`: Bullet movement speed
- `ENEMY_SPAWN_RATE`: Enemy spawn probability
- `POWERUP_SPAWN_RATE`: Power-up spawn probability
- `ENEMY_BASE_SPEED`: Base enemy speed
